# PipeLine_with_DAG_on_HackerNews
Write a pipeline prototype with a directional acyclic graph scheduler for multiple dependancy.
Utilize the pipeline to process a .json file which contains stories from HackerNews, and extract the top topic words.

The point of this project is to have a better understanding of function wrapper/decorator and python closure via writing such a simple working pipeline and its application in a simple NPL task.
